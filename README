howdy.

this readme details my project proposal for my semester long project in COS 377 Spring 2020.

I'm going to make some kind of 3D interactive art piece / video game.
I'm still in the conceptual stage, so there's no telling what it will look like.  I'm in
the process of character design at the moment.

I've installed Maya on my personal PC (yay, student discounts and free software).  I'll be
teaching myself how to use the program, and mocking up some models that may be used in the
final product.

that's all, for now.
